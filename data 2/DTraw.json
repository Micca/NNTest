Just feed me! Posted on: April 26, 2018", "content": "Matsuya Dining: Omakase! Just feed me! Posted on: April 26, 2018\nFans of Chef Benson Teo will be happy to know that he has now moved to bigger premises where there is a proper kitchen to offer a full spectrum of cooked food aside from sushi and sashimi.\nI first wrote about Ben when he was at Matsuya Sushi Bar . It was his first venture after working at various Japanese restaurants for over two decades.\nWhat I like about the place is the casual atmosphere where you can enjoy quality fish at a reasonable price. By reasonable, I mean omakase sets which include fresh otoro, uni and Japanese wagyu priced between $100-$150.\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I find it more comfortable being served by a local sushi chef because of the language barrier I experience with Japanese chefs. When you are sitting at a sushi bar, being able to hold a conversation with the sushi chef is part and parcel of the whole sushi experience.\nI have always liked Chef Ben\u2019s sense of balance for flavours. His kani, negitoro and ikura don, is one of the best I have come across. But at the old place, he only had a blow torch and a broiler so there was never a chance to try his grilled, simmered and fried dishes! So, I was excited to learn last year that he would be moving to bigger premises which will have a proper kitchen!\nThe quality of the fish at Matsuya dining is very good. It isn\u2019t super high end like what they would use at $400 omakase places but it is more affordable while not sacrificing on quality. The tuna and hotate for instance are fresh, not frozen and thawed. Although he doesn\u2019t specifically go for the top tier tuna like those that come from Oma, the quality is very good. I got to try his nama saba and it doesn\u2019t have that off-putting fishiness. (Some people like it, but I am very sensitive to it) Hikarimono (silver skin fish) like saba turns fishy very easily and so it\u2019s good gauge of freshness of the fish as well as the chef\u2019s skills of preparing it for sashimi. 4.5/5\nChef showcased his hobayaki where he piled thin slices of well marbled Miyazaki A5 wagyu over a pool of ginger flavoured sweet miso paste. Needless to say, this was one of the highlight of our meal. The ginger miso paste was very well balanced and paired with the beef very well without overwhelming it. 4.5/5\nThe next course was an egglant dish where the flesh of the eggplant is first scooped out and then deep fried and added back to the shell with fried hirame (halibut) and scallops. The fried items were then topped with a dashi based sauce with grated daikon . It was good but I felt the sauce could have had a bit more punch. 4/5\nThe one dish I was ambivalent about was the tempura prawns and asparagus wrapped with nori. It just didn\u2019t resonate with me. 3.5/5\nOur kakis were treated to a simmered kama toro (tuna collar) which is the kind of thing that was begging for a bowl of rice. This is a special dish that chef serves whenever he can get his hands on the belly part of tuna collar. It\u2019s not available all of the time, so you will be very lucky if you get it as part of your omakase meal. 4.25/5\nWith the new dining concept, Chef has steered away from being a Sushi Bar to an omakase dining concept. You can still sit at the counter and order a sushi course, but it would be a shame not to be able to taste some of the cooked food. That said, the sushi is very good and if you are just looking for a sushi meal.\nThe final dish of the savoury course was a fish meat somen in clear dashi. The noodles were satisfyingly crunchy and chewy at the same time. The dashi broth could have been a little stronger. 4.25/5\nFor most Japanese omakase restaurant, dessert is almost like an afterthought. Most would simply serve a slice of fruit just to end the meal with something sweet. We were given a slice of cheesecake which was made in-house. It was a sweet ending to a great meal but not something I can rave about. 3.5/5\nConclusion\nMid range pricing, mid to upper end quality. Worth giving a try if you are looking for a quality Japanese restaurant that you can go back to on a regular basis.\nSpecial Ieatishootipost Mother\u2019s Day 8 Course Set $88+ (Valid till end May 2018) 1.

matter\nall right well there's nothing in here so my Lords leave all right cool\nhere's that a robot again I'm assuming there's bunch of them I\nguess there's kind of just all roaming around I don't

But before I show you how,\nlet's take a moment to review what we did before and why we did it that way.\nIf you prefer to get started right away though, feel free to fast forward to 1:18.\nSo back in part 23, I showed you how to create stretchy IK limbs\nusing a combination of Measurement nodes and Driven Keys.\nAs part of that, I also told you to save the IK Arm_CTRLs' default position as a Preset.\nThis is because the default position of the arms isn't always a universal thing:\nSome people like T-Pose, others prefer A-Pose,\nand in some rare cases, some people prefer something else entirely.\nLeaving 0,0,0 at the origin gave all these possibilities a common ground.\nIt also simplified our IK/FK matching script in Appendix A.\nBut what if you knew for a fact that your animator preferred a specific default pose?\nOr what if you needed the rig to align with others? \nLuckily, there's a way to do that, which I'll show you now.\nSo here we have our finished rig from Appendix B,\ncomplete with the IK/FK Matching App we developed, as well as Stretchy IK toggles. \nI'm going to set my default pose to a T-Pose, but this will work with any start pose you like.\nLet me just switch to IK mode first.\nIf I select the arm control, notice these non-zero values in the Channel Box.\nThis is what I want to change.\nSo I'll right-click, then go to Freeze > Translate.\nNow I can return to my default position by setting all the translate values to 0.\nWhile that's all good, look at what happens when I try to use the Match App now.\nIt breaks.\nSo why did this happen? Well, recall how we built the Match App in the first place.\nIt takes a duplicate of the IK Arm Ctrl that lives inside the Result skeleton space\u2026\n\u2026then matches the actual Arm Ctrl to it. \nHowever, by freezing the Arm Ctrl just now, we've actually changed its relative zero position.\nTo think about it another way, suppose John and Sue run a foot race \nstarting from the same point. Their finish times would be relative.\nHowever, if John were to start further up the course, their times would no longer be relative.\nTo fix this (as well as our Match App), we'll need to take the gap into account.\nFirst, I'm going to create a new snap joint by duplicating the Arm Ctrl\nand then parent it to the leftHand_result_JNT, just like in Appendix A.\nThis will change the values to reflect the new space it lives in, without moving the copy.\nThen I'll just delete the old snap joint, rename this one, and then delete its shape.\nHowever, this alone isn't enough to fix our Match App,\nbecause it depended on the fact that both the result skeleton and hand control\nhad the same start position in world space, just like in our foot race example.\nSo to fix that, I'm going to modify the IK matching procedure in our script\nso it no longer makes that assumption.\nInstead, I'm going to start at the Arm_CTRL's current position,\nthen \"work forwards\" toward the Snap_GRP's position.\nUsing our race analogy again, this would be like shifting Sue up to John's start point.\nLuckily, whenever you freeze a node's position,\nits relative position in world space is preserved by its Rotate Pivot.\nSure enough, if I check the Arm Ctrl and snap GRP's pivot values,\nyou'll see that they're non-zero. \nAt the moment they're also identical, but that'll change as the arm moves around.\nIt's more important that they're non-zero. That's the key.\nLike I said before, we're going to start the match at the Arm Ctrl's current position,\nso that's \"leftArm_CTRL\".\nNow we need to work forwards.\nTo do that, I'll first store both the snap_GRP's Rotate Pivot,\nand Arm_CTRL's Rotate Pivot in their own variables ($t_rp1 and $t_rp2 respectively).\nThen I'll subtract those spaces and add the difference to the Arm CTRL's current position. \nI'll need to do that once for X, Y, and Z.\nThis \"+=\" notation just indicates that I want to add to t_hand's current value, \nrather than overwrite it.\nNow we have a matching script that works on relative terms,\nrather than absolute world space terms.\nTo finish our race analogy, that means we're measuring Sue's time relative to John.\nNow all that's left is to test the script again.\nIt works!\nNot only that, but you'll find that it works at any scale and orientation too.\nThen just repeat the process for the right side and your rig is good to go!\nFor more infomation >> Creating a Character Rig: Appendix D - Freezing IK controls - Duration: 6:34. \nFORTNITE NEW CUSTOM MATCHMAKING COMING SOON? - Duration: 2:39. what is going on guys it is your boy Yogge here and today we're gonna be\ntimeout custom matchmaking in for night battle oh yeah so guys if you do not\nknow yet obviously on Twitter and on just basically around a whole fortnight\ncommunity the idea of custom matchmaking has been going around for a couple of\nmonths now actually it started last month and it's still going on right now\nbut today we got our first actual piece of like proof I guess it was mainly a\nscreenshot but it's still somewhat type of proof that custom matchmaking is\ncoming very very soon it's our ear oh they're just gonna show\nyou guys right now on screen so here is a picture right here so I'm guessing\nthis is on Xbox or it could be somebody playing on PC but using the Xbox\ncontroller apparently some people also found this in the patch three point five\npoint one of files but somebody found this on console so if you guys can't\ntell obviously the button that is missing from you the game right now is\nthe left trigger or the l2 button on ps4 which is custom matchmaking and\nobviously if you guys do stay tuned with you know four nights Twitter and stuff\nlike that you'll see that they haven't they didn't mention this at all so it\ncould possibly be that they were just testing this to just to see if like the\nbutton is working or they could have been working on it for like a couple of\nmonths now so we really do not know when is gonna come out but it will be coming\nin the near future and this is just the first you know piece of proof that is\ngonna be coming so yeah guys I don't know the idea of 1v1 set custom\nmatchmaking has been in foreigner for a minute now but nobody has really you\nknow actually thought that they were gonna bring it but this is the first\nstep of proof to show us that it is coming soon in the near future are no\nterm which I think about us in the comments down below I'm actually really\nreally happy that they add it in or they're adding in a custom matchmaking\nfeature so I can finally won't be one people that say that they're better than\nme also you can do a lot of stuff with this hopefully they're gonna add in my\nextra you know special game most accustomed matchmaking frags am I like\nMichael Myers or you know just something like that you know make the game more\nfun to play and also you know there's big streamers and they want to do like a\nbig event they can obviously do custom match make it to you know by everybody\nand stuff like that as well I don't know it seems like a good idea to me but tell\nme what you guys thinking about us and the comments down below again like I\nsaid I feel like it's a good idea I hope it does come mainly because of all of\nyou ones I don't wanna 1v1 people a lot so yeah guys if you guys heard of\nanimations you like stealthy you know yeah\nI'll see you guys on the black boys AP niggas beat hardest foot riding in the\nmotherfucking Hill okay if I can shout I begin his head waiter recipes pause I\nneed my man's that easy math the only subject I feel I'm not riding in a\nmotherfucking hell cat if I catch her I'll be given his head\nFor more infomation >> FORTNITE NEW CUSTOM MATCHMAKING COMING SOON? - Duration: 2:39. \nK\u1ebft qu\u1ea3 c\u1ee7a ch\u1ea1y bo PUBG - Duration: 14:36.

Nakau has 470 branches in Japan. In Tokyo, they have over 80 restaurants, so you can find Nakau restaurant pretty easily. When my husband and I lived in Osaka, there was Nakau restaurant located very close to his former workplace. He sometimes went there to eat their delicious gyudon for lunch. I also ate out at the restaurant with him once in a while. I really loved Nakau's gyudon. In my opinion, their gyudon is better quality and has superior taste. ;) They also have some kinds of Japanese bowl dishes, Kyoto style noodles and more. By the way, their most popular one is oyakodon (\u89aa\u5b50\u4e3c), Japanese chicken and egg bowl.\nOyakodon (\u89aa\u5b50\u4e3c), Chicken and Egg Bowl\nNakau (\u306a\u304b\u536f)\n In order to order your meal, you can buy meal tickets with a ticket vending machine.

You can check the locations from here . ;)\nNakau Meal Ticket Vending Machine\nNakau Meal Ticket Vending Machine\n After purchasing meal tickets, take a seat and put the tickets on the table. A waiter will come and take tickets for you. Your meal will be served soon. :)\nNakau Meal Tickets\n I ordered gyudon (\u548c\u98a8\u725b\u4e3c), a raw egg (\u3053\u3060\u308f\u308a\u5375), deep fried chicken (\u5510\u63da\u3052) and salad with sesame seed salad dressing.\nRegular Size Wafu Gyudon (\u548c\u98a8\u725b\u4e3c \u4e26) for 380 yen As you can see the photo above, their gyudon is a little different from ones other gyudon restaurants serve. Nakau's gyudon has white green onions instead of brown onion, and it also has konnyaku noodles, which is called ito konnyaku (\u7cf8\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3083\u304f) or shirataki (\u3057\u3089\u305f\u304d) in Japan. Their gyudon is slightly sweeter (It's because it's wafu taste.) than ones from other gyudon restaurants.\nA Raw Egg (\u3053\u3060\u308f\u308a\u5375) for 70 yen Like always , I added a raw egg over gyudon. ;) I always love a raw egg from Nakau. Usually, egg yolks are yellow, but their egg yolks are always orange and have richer taste. You might think eating a raw egg is insane because it might be contaminated with salmonella. However, most Japanese people have been eating raw eggs all their life with no problems. Japanese eggs are clean and safer. You can check out my previous entry, How to Make Tamago Kake Gohan - Raw Egg on Rice .\nFive Pieces of Deep-Fried Chicken (\u5510\u3042\u3052) for 150 yen I also ordered their deep-fried chicken. These five pieces of delicious deep-fried chicken were only 150 yen! I really loved them. They were crunchy outside and soft inside. ;)\nSalad with Wafu Sesame Salad Dressing (100 yen) I ordered salad with wafu sesame salad dressing. You can choose salad dressing from wafu sesame dressing (\u3054\u307e) and green shiso leave dressing (\u9752\u3058\u305d). Sesame dressing has savory and sweet taste and green shiso leave dressing has sour soy sauce taste.\nSmall Size of Soba Noodles with Duck Meat (\u9d28\u305d\u3070 \u5c0f) for 340 yen He ordered gyudon there, and he also ordered small size of soba noodles with duck meat. On New Year's Eve, it's a Japanese traditional to eat soba noodles, which are called toshikoshi soba (\u5e74\u8d8a\u3057\u305d\u3070). The soup was really good! Actually, Nakau was originally founded as a noodle restaurant in Osaka in 1969. Their noodle menu is also pretty popular. (By the way, this duck meat soba was seasonal menu, so you cannot find one there now.) A few days ago, I watched Japanese TV show that Japanese curry udon is very popular for foreign tourists now. Nakau also has curry udon for 590 yen if you want to try one. ;)\nNakau Curry Udon (\u30d7\u30ec\u30df\u30a2\u30e0\u30ab\u30ec\u30fc\u3046\u3069\u3093) for 590 yen You can check out official Nakau website for their menu and locations in English.\n After enjoying early lunch at Nakau, we headed toward Muji Yurakucho, the largest Muji store in Tokyo. I'll write about it next time . :)\n These are my entries you might like.\n\u2665 How to Order Gyudon, Japanese Beef Bowl, at Matsuya - New Year's Japan Travel Day 3\n\u2665 Top 10 Most Popular Japanese Foods\n\u2665 Top 10 Japanese Beauty Products Loved by Foreign Tourists in Japan\n\u2665 14 Best Japanese Beauty Products I Purchased in Japan - Drugstore, Discount Store, Daiso and Loft Haul\n\u2665 13 Best Japanese Products I Purchased on Amazon Japan! - Beauty, Kitchen and Stationery Items\n\u2665 13 Muji Products I Purchased in Japan - Muji Haul\n\u2665 What You Should Take to Japan - Japan Travel Tips\n\u2665 My Shopping List for Japanese Beauty Products - What I Want to Get in Japan\n\u2665 My Shopping List for Japanese Groceries (Ramen, Sweets, Snack and More) - What I Want to Get in Japan\n\u2665 My Shopping List for Japanese Products (Stationery, Kitchen Items, Starbucks and More) - What I Want to Get in Japan\n\u2665 3 Best Facial Sheet Masks Loved in Japan This Year\n\u2665 7 Most Popular Japanese Facial Cleansing Wipes for Removing Makeup\n\u2665 7 Best Japanese Beauty Products Hall of Fame\n\u2665 Top 5 Life-Changing Japanese Beauty Products\n\u2665 10 Best Japanese Beauty Products on Amazon Japan, You Can Also Purchase Them at Drugstores in Japan\n My entries related to Tokyo can be seen here .\n My entries related to Best Japanese Beauty Products can be seen here .\n My entries related to Japan can be seen here .\n My entries related to beauty can be seen here .\n My entries related to Japan Haul can be seen here .\n You can find my beauty entries by categories from here .\n", "description": " As I mentioned in my previous entry, How to Order Gyudon, Japanese Beef Bowl, at Matsuya , In Japan, there are four major gyudon restaurant chains, Yoshinoya (\u5409\u91ce\u5bb6), Matsuya (\u677e\u5c4b), Sukiya (\u3059\u304d\u5bb6) and Nakau (\u306a\u304b\u536f).
