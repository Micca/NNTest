[{"content": "Volkswagen\u2019s Dieselgate Settlement Billions Are Funding Electric Vehicle Charging Corridors. Can They Help Overcome Range Anxiety? April 13, 2018 by Energy Innovation Leave a Comment Volkswagen is finally atoning for Dieselgate, investing $2 billion in electric vehicles (EVs) and other clean transportation across the United States as part of the massive settlement, along with $2.7 billion paid into a trust fund to help states reduce transportation emissions. This trust fund will be allocated based on the prevalence of illegal diesel engines in those states, and states can use 15% of it to directly fund EV charging infrastructure. \nThe VW money parallels increasing forecasts for the number of EVs on the road. Bullish prognosticators like BNEF have EVs hitting 10% of sales as soon as 2025, and ramping up to the majority of sales within a decade after. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, which consistently lags on emerging technology forecasts , projects EV penetration to remain under 10% in 2050. \nMultiple states have set ambitious EV sales targets , and several have outlined multi-state charging corridor plans as marquee initiatives to spur EV adoption. But with limited funds to lay the foundation for a burgeoning industry capable of dramatically reducing transportation emissions , public agencies must carefully prioritize where they spend VW\u2019s billions. \nWhat Will Jump-Start The EV Transition? \nThe policy blueprint to jump-start America\u2019s EV market is the same as the one renewable energy followed starting around 2000: provide a policy push through incentives and mandates to climb the learning curve and drive down capital costs, and then let the market take over once EVs are cost-competitive. \nLike renewables, price is only the beginning; even after EVs reach price parity, policymakers must also think about complementary policies like access to charging, electricity prices, utility pilots, dealership education, and consumer awareness to jump-start the EV transition. \nU.S. states are getting the demand-push done. Most U.S. demand is coming from states that signed on to California\u2019s zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate \u2014 Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont. The ZEV mandate requires automakers to increase their share of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) relative to total sales over time, reaching 15.4% of total sales in 2025, or 3.3 million EVs on the road. Washington and Colorado are also leader states, offering attractive incentives for would-be EV purchasers. U.S. states with ZEV mandates. \nHowever, only California is on pace to hit its ZEV goal, reaching 4.5% of in-state auto sales in 2017. In the Northeast, where a Montreal-to-D.C. charging corridor funded by VW\u2019s millions is being discussed, EV adoption is lagging far behind the ZEV mandate despite the fact that most of these states offer similar financial incentives to California. In other words, EV purchase prices are virtually the same, but fewer EVs are being sold in the Northeast. So what explains the difference? \nFor one, consumer preferences diverge between regions \u2013 a 2016 survey of ZEV mandate states conducted by Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) found 55% of California consumers were likely to consider an EV when purchasing their next car, compared to 35% in Northeastern states. But an explanation for the difference in preferences can be hard to pin down. While the UCS survey found more than half of California consumers consider buying EVs, only 5% did in 2017. The contrast is even starker in the Northeast, where less than 2% of consumers went for an EV. \nPotential buyers may get discouraged by being unable to find ZEVs at dealers \u2013 Sierra Club volunteers who visited dealers in ZEV mandate states were 2.5 times less likely to find EVs on dealership lots in the nine other ZEV states than they were in California. Charging availability and awareness is another key factor. A 2016 consumer survey by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found customers were much more likely to consider EVs \u201cas good as gas-powered vehicles\u201d when they were aware of charging infrastructure on commonly traveled routes. \nThe UCS survey also examined which kind of EV charging infrastructure can help alleviate customer concerns, asking for the top three attributes that would make drivers more likely to consider purchasing or leasing a plug-in EV. \u201cDriving over 200 miles on one charge\u201d was the second-most common answer behind price reduction. \nSimilarly, lack of charging stations where drivers travel was the biggest concern for owning a plug-in EV in the Northeast, and the second biggest concern in California, behind lack of range on a single charge. Americans love a good road trip, and range anxiety is at or near the top of their minds when they decide not to buy an EV. \nWhich Type Of EV Chargers Can Quell Range Anxiety? \nThough charger availability is clearly linked to EV uptake , public charging infrastructure alone doesn\u2019t necessarily increase EV ownership. While California has more total public EV chargers than all Northeastern ZEV states combined, more chargers exist per EV in the Northeast than in California. Public charging infrastructure is not a clear causal factor in ZEV adoption rates \u2013 California only has four public charging ports per 100 EVs, while most Northeastern states have more than eight public chargers per 100 EVs. Relationship between charger availability and ZEV sales in ZEV-mandate states. \nThat\u2019s not to say public EV infrastructure has no impact on consumers choices. California emphasizes fast EV chargers that have a special role in reducing range anxiety by refueling 150 miles of range in less than 30 minutes. California leads the nation with 586 stations (each with multiple outlets), compared to just 319 total in Northeastern states. \nWorkplace or public charging, particularly fast-charging, for those without access to residential charging or long commutes will be essential for renters to enter the market as well. Given that rental rates are the highest they\u2019ve been in 50 years at 36% of U.S. households, lack of public or workplace charging may yet be a significant barrier to deeper market penetration. \nEV Charging Corridors Spread Across The U.S. \nGiven the unique role of public charging infrastructure in enabling longer drives and quelling range anxiety among potential EV buyers, interstate high-speed charging corridors have emerged as popular options for spending VW settlement funds and encouraging EV ownership, including recent proposals in the Northeast and Mountain West. \nSix New England states may allocate $30 million in VW settlement money (the full amount possible for EV infrastructure) to build a charging corridor, primarily on interstate highways, from Quebec to as far south as Washington, D.C. This corridor will prioritize fast-charging infrastructure, allowing drivers, particularly EV-owning tourists from Montreal, to rapidly refuel while spending their loonies stateside. Though discussions are in a preliminary phase, many of the states are targeting range anxiety to boost tourism and in-state EV adoption. \nIn addition to the Northeast proposal, nine Mountain West states announced they will build a high-speed charging corridor to facilitate EV interstate travel and reduce range anxiety. The Intermountain West Electric Corridor coalesced around Colorado\u2019s regional leadership, spanning Arizona, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Montana, Wyoming, Nevada, and Idaho. Colorado has already announced plans to build fast chargers along its interstate highways, and the eight other states are in a coordination phase with Colorado to apply for DOE grants, coordinate VW settlement money, and create a coherent structure with utility partners. EV charging corridors in Colorado and the Western U.S. \nWhether fast chargers are the best way to use public funds to increase EVs on the road is hard to know, but they\u2019re certainly a positive step toward reducing range anxiety concerns for buyers considering an EV, even if they\u2019re just a piece of a larger puzzle. Charging corridors, coupled with public education and interstate planning, are a good use of public funds to decarbonize transportation . \nEV expert Chris Nelder , who leads the Rocky Mountain Institute\u2019s EV-Grid Integration initiative , agrees. \u201cCharging corridor investments will be effective if they are mainly spent on fast chargers, if buyers design their RFPs to require interoperability and compatibility with open-source standards, and if legislatures and utility regulators create appropriate opportunities for additional investments to scale up. The VW money by itself is only going to address a fraction of the need.\u201d \nBy Mike O\u2019Boyle, Energy Innovation\u2019s Electricity Policy Manager", "id": -103067290, "author": null, "title": "Volkswagen\u2019s Dieselgate Settlement Billions Are Funding Electric Vehicle Charging Corridors.

The new man is Herbert Diess . Diess is an engineer who came to the VW Group having been development boss at BMW, and responsible for the i3 and i8 as well as the conventional cars. So it\u2019s likely that VW\u2019s new focus on electrifying its lineup will be safe with him. \nAlso, remember, BMW is the only German company that has come through the whole diesel emissions business without any of its engines showing up with questionable real-world results. And before his time as R&D chief there, Diess had been the purchasing boss, responsible for cost control, vital to profit. \nHe had been lining himself up to be CEO of BMW, but instead the job went to a rival. So Diess took up his bat and ball and got a job at the VW Group in summer 2015. \nWithin weeks, the diesel scandal engulfed VW. Here was a man, Diess, whose hands were obviously clean. Yet he didn\u2019t get the CEO job when the previous incumbent, Martin Winterkorn, was toppled by the scandal. \nInstead it went to Muller. To anyone versed in the byzantine internal politicians at VW, Muller\u2019s appointment must have seemed sensible. He was a company lifer, so he would steady the ship. But to outsiders, Muller\u2019s appointment seemed a huge PR fumble. He had been head of the group\u2019s global product strategy at the very time the cheating engine was being rolled out across Europe and America. \nStill, in his two and a half years in charge of the Group, Muller has made sweeping and positive changes . Most especially, he has pushed ahead with the plan to build dozens of electric models across the brands, and also launched the mobility services brand Moia and emphasized autonomous driving research. \nDiess has to carry on with all that. But in the meantime he must prove to the world that the VW Group is able to build clean diesels. These remain a vast part of its portfolio and vital to cutting average CO2 emissions until the EVs are ready for primetime. \nAt the same time as elevating Diess, the Group has shaken up its management divisions. It frequently does this, in attempts to shake up its hidebound culture and slow decision making. Now there will be a \u2018volume\u2019 section of brands\u2014VW, Seat, Skoda. Diess has direct charge of this. Then there\u2019s \u2018premium\u2019, which is Audi. Then \u2018super-premium\u2019 (Porsche, Bentley, Lamborghini, Bugatti). Another is China. And finally trucks, which is likely to be sold off soon to raise capital. ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \nDiess is also taking personal charge of R&D and in-car IT/digitization. He said: \u201cIn a phase of profound upheaval in the automotive industry, it is vital for Volkswagen to pick up speed and make an unmistakable mark in e-mobility, the digitalization of the automobile and transportation as well as new mobility services.\u201d \nAlso on his plate is continuing cost reduction . VW is part-owned by the Region of Lower Saxony, the area of Germany that includes Wolfsburg. The region is keen to bolster local employment, so gives big sway to the unions. That\u2019s good for local employment, but also pushes up wages, cutting into VW\u2019s profit. \nOddly though, even after the extraordinary turmoil at VW\u2014and the fact it\u2019s become increasingly clear that knowledge of the cheating was far more widespread than the initial claim of \u2018a few engineers\u2019\u2014car sales have hardly been affected. Profits over the past few years have been sufficient to cover the fines and recall costs of dieselgate. VW has slipped through it all unscathed, and indeed fitter for the future. \nNOTE: This article first appeared on TopGear.com . Minor edits have been made.
